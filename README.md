# Improving Machine Learning Performance

Improving machine learning model performance for predicting loan status. 

Task : Classification

## Requirements
* Python 3.7 or above
* Modules:
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * seaborn
  * matplotlib
  * scipy
  * sklearn
  * datetime
  * imblearn

## Dataset


## Steps to Improve Classification Model
* Feature Engineering
* Oversampling
* Hyper-parameter Tuning


## Classification Model
In the main experiment (with the aim of improving model performance), we performed a comparison between the 2 models:
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

We also tried to see the performance of other models:
* Logistic Regression
* Stochastic Gradient Classifier
* Support Vector Machine Linear (SVC)
